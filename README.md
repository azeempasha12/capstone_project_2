problem16: 
The optimized approach is considered better due to its lower space complexity. By rearranging the array elements in place,
it eliminates the need for additional data structures like hash sets, which are required in the traditional approach. 
Although the optimized approach is more complex and modifies the input array, it is more efficient for larger
inputs where space complexity is a critical factor.



problem17:
 the Optimized Approach is Better because
 
Efficiency:
The optimized approach uses linear time complexity O(n) compared to the quadratic time complexity O(n^2) of the traditional approach. This makes it significantly faster for larger input strings.

Simplicity:
The optimized approach is simpler and more concise, leveraging the built-in capabilities of JavaScript's Set to handle duplicates.
Scalability:
The optimized approach is better suited for handling large input strings, given its linear time complexity.

Conclusion
The optimized approach is preferable due to its better time complexity, simplicity, and scalability, making it more efficient for removing duplicates from large strings while preserving the order of characters.



problem18:
 Optimized Approach is Better because

Efficiency:
The optimized approach is simpler and faster because it leverages the built-in slice() method.
It avoids the extra checks and temporary array manipulations needed in the traditional approach.

Simplicity:
The optimized approach is more concise and easier to understand. It directly slices the array in chunks, making the logic clearer and more straightforward.

Scalability:
The optimized approach is better suited for handling larger arrays efficiently because it uses a linear time complexity O(n).
Conclusion
The optimized approach is preferable due to its better time complexity, simplicity, and scalability. It makes the process of dividing students into groups more efficient and easier to implement.



problem19:
Optimized Approach are better because
Sort the Array:
Just like in the traditional approach, start by sorting the array.

Initialize Pointers:
Use two pointers: left starting at the beginning and right at the end of the sorted array.

Shuffle the Array:
While left is less than right:
Add the number at left (smallest) and move the left pointer to the right.
Add the number at right (largest) and move the right pointer to the left.

Handle the Middle Element:
If left equals right after the loop, add that middle element to the result.

Return the Result:
The result array is now shuffled as required.





problem20:
Optimized Approach are better because
Hash Map (Object):
You use an object (hash map) to keep track of the numbers you need to find a pair.
For each number in the array, you calculate the difference between the target sum and the current number.
You check if this difference is already in the hash map.
If it is, you have found your pair and return it.
If it isn't, you store the current number in the hash map with the difference as the key.

Efficiency:
The traditional approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it uses nested loops to check each pair of numbers.
The optimized approach has a time complexity of O(n) because it uses a single loop and a hash map for constant-time lookups.

Simplicity:
The optimized approach simplifies the process by reducing the number of loops and leveraging the power of hash maps for quick lookups.

Scalability:
The optimized approach can handle larger arrays more efficiently, making it more suitable for real-world applications where the array can have up to 10^5 elements.
