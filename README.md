problem16: 
The optimized approach is considered better due to its lower space complexity. By rearranging the array elements in place,
it eliminates the need for additional data structures like hash sets, which are required in the traditional approach. 
Although the optimized approach is more complex and modifies the input array, it is more efficient for larger
inputs where space complexity is a critical factor.
